## Running the game ##

If the version of SFML that you want to install is available in the official repository, then install it using your package manager.

For example, on Debian, Ubuntu you would do:
``` shell
sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev
```

Now you will need to compile the program:
``` shell
g++ -std=c++17 -c *.cpp
```
You must then link the compiled file to the SFML libraries in order to get the final executable.
``` shell
g++ *.o -o breakout-game -lsfml-graphics -lsfml-window -lsfml-system -lsfml-audio
```
You can now execute the compiled program:
``` shell
./breakout-game
```
